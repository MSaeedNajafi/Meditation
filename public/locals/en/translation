    "WhatisMeditation":"What is Meditation?",
    "WhatisMeditationtxt":" Originally, the word “meditate” meant to think deeply about something. However, when eastern contemplative practices were “imported” to western culture, this is the term that was used to define them, for lack of a better word. Nowadays meditation refers more to the exercise of focusing attention than to reflecting deeply. Meditation is a mental exercise that involves relaxation, focus, and awareness. Meditation is to the mind what physical exercise is to the body. The practice is usually done individually, in a still, seated position and with eyes closed. ",

    "abouttxt":" Hello dear friend, my name is Fauzia and I'm inviting you to celebrate and explore the aspects of yourself that you may have discovered already. My intention is to offer you support while you develop this inner source of resilience and learn how to be more confident and balanced in your life, relationships and career. Especially the relationship with yourself. From this point you are able to enjoy the most fulfilled life. My spiritual journey started over 20 years ago with study of inherent wisdom and truth from great minds such as Plato, Marcus Aurelius, Buddha, Marsilio Ficino, James Allen and more, so that I could embody the universal message they all convey. By practicing yoga, meditation and study I stay connected to my inner self. I have pieced together my life’s puzzle and accept and appreciate the joyful person I am today. I believe passionately that meditation should be practiced in everyday life, everywhere around the world, because only by accepting and appreciating ourselves we can truly understand and bring calm, joy and happiness into your soul.
